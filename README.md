# Java-Refresher

-----------

This repository contains things that i commonly need to re-learn things about Java after a long time, this includes the common ways to do things such as looping, flow-control etc. As well as certain idiosyncrasies and powerful features of the Java Language Itself.          

The core of the repo is in the `/book` folder which contains individual chapters, which contain explanations of features of the language as well as code to demonstrate them.            

The code is also separately present in the `/src` folder.
